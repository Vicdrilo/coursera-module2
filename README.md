Hi, here you are!

Welcome to my repository which contains the html and css files. Don't be afraid to correct me, 
please. If almost everything is no correct, please help me to learn the mistakes. I had several problems with the position of the subtitles 
of each box and also I think I did a botched job with the margin between the boxes. If you did it different way, please show me how.
By the way, I don't know why but the webpage doesn't run well on github (it doesn't have the styles, if you know why tell me please), 
so try to run it on the editor you use.

Thank you.
